## [3.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Added `miniconda` support
- Added CUDA 12.6.3 and cuDNN 9.5.1.17 support for Ubuntu 24.04

### Fixed
- Fixed the command that was listing the available cuDNN support
- Fixed the `cuda_devel.txt` to actually support Ubuntu 24.04 onwards by moving `libtinfo5` and `libncursesw5` out of it and adding it to the python generation function
- Fixed `is_cuda_version_supported()` not using directly 'ubuntu_version' as it was already the 'flat' version

### Changed
- Changed the base image of NVIDIA builds. Now we just use ubuntu images as base images and not `nvidia/opengl`

## [3.2.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added

- Added `git-lfs` to `dockerfile_templates/install_common_packages.txt`

### Fixed
- Fixed `zsh` autocompletion issue in ROS2

### Changed
- Introduced `dockerfile_templates/ros2_extra.txt` to explicitly define extra ROS packages and reduced scope of ros2.txt

### Removed
- Removed python installation from `dockerfile_templates/conan.txt` as python is installed by default now
- Removed any pip upgrades from template files as pip is being upgraded by default at `dockerfile_templates/python.txt`

## [3.1.1] - 2025-03-21

### Fixed
- Fixed issue in the `dockerfile_templates/conan.txt` which was braking the build command

- Fixed typos in `README.md`

## [3.0.4] - 2024-12-11

### Fixed
- Fixed issue in the `dockerfile_assets/entrypoint_setup.sh` where the `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` was not properly escaped causing `chown` errors.

## [3.0.3] - 2024-09-19

### Fixed
- Fixed issue in the parsing of the "extra packages" where, if a custom version was specified, it was neglected and always the latest was being picked.

### Fixed
- Suppress "InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made to host 'apt.llvm.org'", when using `verify=False` in `requests.get()`.

## [3.0.1] - 2024-07-12

### Changed
